## True story...

Once, while I was studying at university, I shared a flat with some other students renting a **"passing room"**, which means people needed to pass through it to go into another room.  

So one day, while I was in my room *having fun* with my girlfriend, my flatmate knocked on the door and asked:
> Hi, Giulio! Can I come in?

I answered:
> Please, if you wait just 5 more minutes, I will do it too...
